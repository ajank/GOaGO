Description: GO-a-GO annotates Gene Ontology terms that are enriched in a given
    set of gene pairs. The enrichment is calculated from a permutation test for
    overrepresentation of gene pairs that are associated with a common term.
    Such gene pairs are counted for the original set of gene pairs and compared
    against randomized sets in which the structure of the pairs is preserved,
    but the gene identities (including the associated terms) are permuted.

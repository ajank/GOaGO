\title{GOaGO: Gene Ontology enrichment analysis in a set of gene pairs}
\description{
GO-a-GO annotates functional terms that are overrepresented in a given set of gene pairs. The enrichment of Gene Ontology terms is calculated from a permutation test for overrepresentation of gene pairs that are associated with a common term.
